# This script reads all of the IP addresses from the interface status files
# located in /var/lib/interface-status. The platform creates and removes status
# files there as system interfaces come and go. This includes WAN, LAN and
# others such as OpenVPN, L2TP, GRE, etc.
#
# We use the address list we create to update /etc/hosts.untangle which is
# loaded by dnsmasq. We include an entry for each unique IP configured on the
# server, and we end up with multiple entries for the configured hostname.
# The dnsmasq daemon is configured to return the best matching IP for
# our hostname based on address of the interface where the query was received.
# This allows captive portal redirect using hostname instead of IP to work
# because we resolve the hostname to an address appropriate for the client
# and the network on which they are located.
