documents.

- Page numbers can use Arabic-Indic, Kanji, Katakana, Hiragana,
Cyrillic and Armenian numerals.

- Compressed SVG images are properly recognized and processed.

- Memory management has been improved, the formatter now uses memory
pools and weak references to avoid memory leaks and ensure efficient
resource allocation.

- Both PDF and PostScript use the Latin1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding for
symbols that can be represented in it, thus making post-processing
of generated PDF and PostScript more convenient.

- Formatting of automatically laid out tables is brought into strict
accordance with CSS2. 

- Fixes for bugs discovered since the release of XEP 4 are 
incorporated into the production code.

XEP 4.0

New features
============

1. XEP 4.0 uses a single configuration file for all subcomponents:
formatter options, fonts, and hyphenation are now configured from
a single location. The new format has the following advantages
over the old one:

 - default options for back-ends can be set in the same file;

 - font configuration is more intuitive: font families are created
   directly, and individual fonts are explicitly assigned to specific 
   combinations of font family + weight + style + variant;
  
 - font aliases can resolve to multiple font families;
  
 - font aliases can depend on the language setting.

2. Table processing is now fully conformant to the XSL Recommendation.
In particular, the following features are now supported:

 - automatic table width adjustment (table-layout="auto");

 - collapsed borders (border-collapse="collapse"|"collapse-with-precedence")

3. Additional prepress features are supported:

 - spot and registration colors can be specified in both XSL-FO and SVG;
 
 - bleeds and trim offsets can be controlled by processing instructions,
   and respective marks placed on the page;
   
 - arbitrary SVG images can be placed in the image offset area, to create
   advanced printer marks. The distribution includes sample SVGs for 
   registration targets and color bars.

4. More SVG  features are supported:

 - clipping implementation is extended to cover arbitrary combination
   of path, shapes, and text;
   
 - fill-opacity and stroke-opacity are supported in PDF output only
   (incompatible with PDF version 1.3).

5. Improvements in font handling:

 - TrueType collection fonts are supported;

 - OpenType fonts with CFF outlines are supported, with limitations:
   * in PostScript, only non-CID fonts are supported, and Level 3 is required;
   * subsetting of these fonts is not implemented.
   
 - Automatic slanting is possible, to create oblique and backslant 
   fonts from upright variants.
   
 - Basic support for ligaturization: a list of ligatures can be specified
   in the font configuration.
 

Other Improvements
==================

- XEP can work without write access to local file system. 
  When TMPDIR option is set to 'none', XEP stores all 
  intermediate files in memory. 

- Performance is optimized: memory consumption reduced, 
  table processing speeded up;

- Documentation rearranged and refactored. 
  
Interface Changes
=================

- Deprecated Java interfaces have been removed;

- FormatterImpl takes an optional extra parameter, 
  an XML document describing the configuration 
  (as a generic JAXP source);
    
- Validator now accepts generic JAXP source as input.

  called on exit);

  about missing fonts are issued once per font per document instance,
  all other warnings are not cached;

  custom comments, to facilitate resource management and postprocessing.

XEP 3.0

New XSL Formatting Objects and Properties
=========================================

1. Full implementation of fo:block-container. Reference-orientation and
   writing-mode properties now work on block containers regardless
   of their position. You can now rotate text in the flow and inside
   table cells.

2. Side floats: left and right floats are supported. Additionally,
   'float' attribute can assume values of "inside" and "outside",
   to align it with 'text-align'. (Note that these additional values
   are absent in CSS and missing in the XSL Rec; handle with care).

3. Areas spanned across columns: span="all" is fully supported. There
   is also an rx:flow-section extension element, with a more general
   functionality.

4. Last page recognized in conditional masters: page-position="last"
   now works on fo:conditional-page-master-reference.

5. Breaks fully implemented: "page" value for break-before and break-after
   now works correctly in multi-column layouts.

6. Support for right-to-left writing: writing-mode="rl-tb" is now
   supported. Some bidirectionality is implemented; see spec.dbx
   for details and limitations. Explicit direction override through
   fo:bidi-override is implemented.

7. Support for font-stretch attribute: text can be scaled horizontally.
       
8. Improved support for expressions: expression support redesigned 
   and made more reliable; from-table-column() function implemented. 
   See specs.dbx about limitations on expressions.

9. Support for relative-align. relative-align on fo:list-item is supported.


New Extensions to XSL Recommendation
====================================

1. rx:page-index

Extension to build page number sequences for indices. Merges repeated
page numbers and builds ranges.

2. rx:flow-section

A generalization of 'span' attribute: partitions a flow into sections
with different column counts. Using this extension, it is possible
to mix e.g. two-column and three-column fragments on the same page.

3. rx:pinpoint

Conveys data from the source file to the XML output. Ignored by backends
but visible when filtering output XML structure. Can be used to build
complex postprocessing solutions, e.g. revision bars.


Architectural Improvements
==========================

1. Validator

A new XSLT-based validator catches more errors than the old DTD, and
intercepts any input (not just documents read from a byte stream).
For instance, output from an XSLT engine can now be validated.

There is also a command-line interface to the validator:
com.renderx.xep.Validator takes a sequence of file names as arguments,
and validates them one by one.

2. SAX2 and JAXP

All interfaces (both input and output) are now namespace-aware,
and use SAX2 / DOM Level 2. We have also worked on JAXP pluggability:
if there is a JAXP-compliant parser factory somewhere in the path,
XEP finds it and gets parsers from there (unless explicitly instructed
to use a specific parser).

There is a class to facilitate working with JAXP transformers:
com.renderx.xep.JAXPDriver acts as a transformer that produces
PDF/PostScript from XML+XSL. It also has a command-line interface.
Running the class with no arguments displays the synopsis.

3. New parser

Parser component rewritten from scratch, to optimize memory usage.

4. Performance on table processing

Long tables are now processed up to 5 times faster than in the
previous version. One of the major performance bottlenecks
is therefore eliminated.

5. Optimized graphics

Processing of principal graphic formats has been revised to use "lazy"
algorithms as much as possible, avoiding full image decompression.
