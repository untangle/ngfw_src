/**
 * Class representing an SmtpTransaction. Maintains the state of the transaction (see the enum, which I don't know how
 * to reference with JavaDoc) as well as any TO/FROM EmailAddresses. <br>
 * Since there is some gray area in the "middle" between client and server, this class maintains envelope data
 * (recipients and sender) as "provisional" until they are "confirmed". Confirmed means the server accepted, provisional
 * means the request was issued by client yet final disposition is unknown. <br>
 * <br>
 * This class also implements {@link com.untangle.uvm.util.TemplateValues TemplateValues}. Valid key names which can be
 * derefferenced from an SmtpTransaction begin with the literal <code>$SMTPTransaction:</code> followed by any of the
 * following tokens:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <code><b>TO</b></code> The "TO" addresses, as passed in any "RCPT TO:" commands. Each recipient is on its own line.
 * Even if there is only one recipient, this variable will be substituted with the value of the recipient <i>followed by
 * a CRLF.</i> If there are no recipients (?!?), than this will simply return a blank String ("").</li>
 * <li>
 * <code><b>FROM</b></code> The "FROM" as passed in the "MAIL FROM:" command. If there is no FROM value (or it was
 * "&lt;>"), the literal "&lt;>" will be substituted.</li>
 * </ul>
