1) What's what?

	doc/        - the man files and other documentation
	debian/     - stuff for building debian packages
	include/    - the include stuff that will be installed
	lib/        - the build directory
	src/        - the source
	test/       - testing / sample applications

2) Overview
	
	Libnetcap is a library that "captures" connections.
	It captures a connection in the sense that it will insert itself as a man-in-the-middle
	and it will create two sockets (one for the client, one for the server)
	and it passes these up to the application


3) How it works?

	To create a proxy you create a list of traffic descriptions you wish to intercept
	(currently the selectors are: input device, output device, source, destination, source port
	 destination port, and protocol)

	it redirects traffic with firewall redirect rules
	libnetcap has an abstract concept of a redirect 
	the actualy details of each redirect will differ a lot between systems
	you must remember to remove redirects before exitting
	(or you can just flush them by hand if you wish)


4) Currently supported architectures
	
	Linux 2.6+ with patched iptables 

5) needed packages to build
	fakeroot
	debhelper
	iptables
	kernel patches
	libssl-dev (for test)
